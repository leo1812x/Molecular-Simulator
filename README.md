# Chemical simuator

## Set up for delevopment
Since i tend to forget how to locally run this project, these are the instructions to deploy locally with "hot reload"

1. Run the "watch" comand from package.json
   this conpiles the raw index.js to the bundled version with watchify

2. run `tsc -w` to compile the index.ts file to index.js 

3. host localy with 'Go live' extension in vscode
