# Chemical simulator

## Set up for development
Since I tend to forget how to run this project locally, these are the instructions to deploy locally with "hot reload" using the script in package.json

1. Run the "watch" command from package.json
> This compiles the raw index.js to the bundled version with watchify

2. Run the "compile" command from package.json
> This compiles all Typescript files into javascript files everytime a Typescript file is saved
3. host locally with 'Go live' extension in vscode
