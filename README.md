# Chemical simulator

## Set up for development
Since I tend to forget how to run this project locally, these are the instructions to deploy locally with "hot reload"

1. Run the "watch" command from package.json
> This compiles the raw index.js to the bundled version with watchify

2. run `tsc -w` to compile the index.ts file to index.js 

3. host locally with 'Go live' extension in vscode
